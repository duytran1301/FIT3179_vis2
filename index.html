          Australia is one of many countries that vastly support employment policy.
          According to Moovaz (2021), Australia is ranked 13 in the safest country to live among 163 countries.
          One of the main properties that cause the reduction is Covid-19. But high crime rates are often associated
          with poverty, unemployment, low levels of educational attainment,
          family relationship problems and high levels of drug use. The crime prevalence depends on the availability and
          the potential rewards (ABS, 2010).

            However, during the pandemic the crime rate in Australia is decrease due to the Australia pandemic management system.

            However, comparing to many years before, crime rate is decreasing. 
            The visualisation below shows the change of crime rate over 2 decades in Australia. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As green bar is likely more and larger than red bar. 
            Therefore, the crime rate is said to be decreasing due to the enhancement of policy in Australia. 
            According to Australia government, the country granted fund for unemployment and hardship so that to supplies people when they needed. 
            Therefore, crime prevention is getting better.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since it's a long progress, crime is still happening in Australia, 
            and it can't be denied that people will find solution to keep the drug prevalence continuously.

            Crime usually happens at leisure activities. 
            More precisely, there are many cases commit crime in the Australia state <strong>central business district (CBD)</strong> 
            where bustle and crowded with people in both days and night since its location identifies 
            as the place for working and finding pleasant (Timms, 2022). 
            Therefore, it is also place likely to engage in crime.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/"></a>
            According to <strong>Australia Bureau of Statistics (<a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/">ABS</a>)</strong> that 910 females and 3000 males over 100,000 individuals are offenders in Australia. 
            Therefore, with the city population distribution in gender and age range the visualisation shows 
            that mostly Male commit crime more than female at the age from 15-20. 
            However, at the range rang 85+, female is likely to commit crime more than other age range. 
            But comparing to the total population, female still holds the record that less commit crime than male.
