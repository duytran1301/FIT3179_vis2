        <p>
          Australia is one of many countries that vastly support employment policy.
          According to Moovaz (2021), Australia is ranked 13 in the safest country to live among 163 countries.
          One of the main properties that cause the reduction is Covid-19. But high crime rates are often associated
          with poverty, unemployment, low levels of educational attainment,
          family relationship problems and high levels of drug use. The crime prevalence depends on the availability and
          the potential rewards, (ABS, 2010).

            In a typical year, the fire season in Australia begins around October in most
            states, with some small fires occurring as early as July. However in 2019,
            widespread burning occurred throughout parts of Queensland and New South Wales,
            during the month of September, with numerous fires in other parts of the country.
            The map to the left shows the locations of probable fires in during the months of
            August and September in 2019.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the map, the brightness corresponds roughly to how hot the fire is, offset by
            how emissive the surface of the Earth is at the location the fire
            is burning at. More information can be found

            Therefore, in this case rank A ecstasy having the highest sales in the among other drugs. 
            Because of pandemic to the world, the demand on drugs results in rising stress and since the resilience-promoting activities like social interaction or physical improvement is prohibit as considered unsafe (Abramson, 2022).

            Therefore, many illegal drug overdoses cases increased. 
            (Abramson, 2022) states that the unavailability of medical care also effects on the drug uses.

            However, comparing to many years before, crime rate is decreasing. 
            The visualisation below shows the change of crime rate over 2 decades in Australia. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As green bar is likely more and larger than red bar. 
            Therefore, the crime rate is said to be decreasing due to the enhancement of policy in Australia. 
            According to Australia government, the country granted fund for unemployment and hardship so that to supplies people when they needed. 
            Therefore, crime prevention is getting better.

          <p>
            Since it's a long progress, crime is still happening in Australia, 
            and it can't be denied that people will find solution to keep the drug prevalence continuously.
